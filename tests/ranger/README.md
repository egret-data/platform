# Ranger policy-engine enforcement gate

Proves Egret's ServicePolicies enforce in the real Apache Ranger policy engine
(the same RangerPolicyEngineImpl the Trino plugin runs).

Requires: JDK 11+, Maven, network (pulls
`org.apache.ranger:ranger-plugins-common:2.5.0` from Maven Central, unless
already cached under `~/.m2`).

Run:

```bash
EGRET_TEST_RANGER_E2E=1 cargo test -p egret-policy --test ranger_engine_gate
# or directly:
cd tests/ranger && mvn -q test
```

The `ranger-plugins-common` version is a Maven property, overridable without
editing the POM:

```bash
cd tests/ranger && mvn -q test -Dranger.version=2.8.0
```

Optional — regenerate fixtures/service-policies.json from a running Egret:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer devtoken" \
  "http://localhost:8080/service/plugins/policies/download/trino_prod" \
  > tests/ranger/fixtures/service-policies.json
```

Asserts: alice select allowed; bob denied; column email → MASK_HASH; row filter "country = 'US'".

(ranger-plugins-common version used: **2.5.0**, the harness default)

## Why 2.5.0 is the default

The harness's default (`tests/ranger/pom.xml` `<ranger.version>`) is pinned to
**2.5.0** because that is the `ranger-plugins-common` version the Trino
coordinator egret actually provisions loads at runtime
(`trinodb/trino:470`), measured directly from a live pod's plugin directory —
see `docs/en/plans/2026-09-28-sp4d-plugin-version-result.md`. It is not
2.4.0 (the harness's old, unverified pin) and not 2.8.0 (a figure earlier
misread from `trinodb/trino:latest`, an image egret does not provision).

That same result doc also measured StarRocks's `fe-ubuntu:4.1` image, which
loads `ranger-plugins-common-2.8.0` — a different version from Trino's. The
harness is runnable at 2.8.0 via `-Dranger.version=2.8.0` for that reason,
but 2.5.0 stays the default because Trino is the primary/only engine this
evaluator package targets per the SP4d-1 brief.

Both versions were run clean (`mvn clean test`) against the unmodified
harness and produced **`Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0`** with no
assertion differences between them — Ranger's behaviour for these four cases
(allow, deny, mask, row filter) has not changed between 2.5.0 and 2.8.0.

## API notes (ranger-plugins-common 2.5.0 / 2.8.0)

One adjustment from the task scaffold is still needed to compile/run against
the published 2.5.0 and 2.8.0 artifacts (the local ranger trunk checkout
differs):

- `new RangerPolicyEngineImpl(sp, null, null)` still NPEs in
  `PolicyEngine.<init>` (null pluginContext) at both 2.5.0 and 2.8.0 —
  confirmed by testing a null `pluginContext` directly against 2.5.0, which
  reproduces the same
  `NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "RangerPluginContext.getAuthContext()"`
  as 2.4.0. The test builds a minimal
  `RangerPluginContext(new RangerPluginConfig("trino","trino_prod","egret",null,null,new RangerPolicyEngineOptions()))`.
  Note `RangerPluginConfig` is in `org.apache.ranger.authorization.hadoop.config`.
- The row-filter request resource stops at `table` (no `column`), since the
  Trino `rowFilterDef` only defines catalog/schema/table.

The 2.4.0-only workaround from earlier versions of this doc no longer
applies and has been removed: `JsonUtils.jsonToObject(Reader, Class)` did
not exist in 2.4.0, but it **does exist** in 2.5.0 and 2.8.0 (verified via
`javap` against both jars) alongside the `(String, Class)` overload this
test still uses. The test's use of the `String` overload is not a
workaround at these versions — either overload would work — so it has been
left as-is rather than churned for no behavioural change.

Verified: `mvn clean test` → `Tests run: 4, Failures: 0, Errors: 0` (BUILD
SUCCESS) at both `-Dranger.version=2.5.0` (default) and
`-Dranger.version=2.8.0`, JDK 21 / Maven 3.9.11, 2026-09-28.
